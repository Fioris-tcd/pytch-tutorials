# Boing: Make a Pong-like game

In this tutorial we will make a version of the classic game
[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).  We are going to use the graphics,
and some of the ideas, kindly made available by the [Code the
Classics](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1) book
published by the Raspberry Pi organisation.
