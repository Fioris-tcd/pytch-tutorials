# Tiger-Heli's bomb mechanic

As Mark Vanstone explains in [Issue 45 of Wireframe
magazine](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/issues/45), the game
_Tiger Heli_ was "a topdown shoot-â€™em-up that pitted a lone helicopter

It had a mechanism where you could drop a cluster of bombs, which is
what we'll look at recreating in this tutorial.
