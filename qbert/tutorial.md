# Q*bert: Recreate the cube-hopping action

As Mark Vanstone explains in issue 42 of Wireframe:

> Late in 1982, a funny little orange character with a big nose landed
> in arcades.  The titular Q*bertâ€™s task was to jump around a network of
> cubes arranged in a pyramid formation, changing the colours of each as
> they went.  Once the cubes were all the same colour, it was on to the
> next level.

In this tutorial we'll follow Mark's example and create the basics of
this classic arcade game.

wrong.  Double-count the original block.
